        "description": "As part of a team of six first-year Engineering students in my Engineering Strategies and Practices II course (APS112), we developed a tool to visualize the effects of one-way conversions on driving routes for the City of Toronto Cyclists and Pedestrian's Team. This was achieved using OpenStreetMap Editor to built and export custom traffic restrictions to a JSON file. This file was then processed in Python and used to display custom routes on MapBox API in JavaScript. ",
