        "description": "As part of a team of six first-year Engineering students in my Engineering Strategies and Practices II course (APS112), we developed a tool to visualize the effects of one-way conversions on driving routes for our client, the City of Toronto Cyclists and Pedestrian's Team. This was achieved using the MapBox API in JavaScript and the networkx module in Python to calculate custom routes and communicate via Flask. ",
